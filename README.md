## About  
CatzeFront is a legacy Angular-based frontend application designed for a Minecraft server community. Built as a passion project, it was intended to provide players with a centralized hub for server management, forums, and social interaction. The project is no longer actively maintained but remains available as a reference for Angular development and Minecraft community tools.

- **Forum Integration**: Community-driven discussion boards.
